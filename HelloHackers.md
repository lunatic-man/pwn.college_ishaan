## Hello Hackers 

# Challenge 1: Intro to commands 
In this challenge of Linux Luminarium Dojo, Hello Hackers module,we are required to type in our first command, '''hello''' to get the flag. 

# MY SOLVE FLAG: pwn.college{8QtViaO8Ypm0P1h8mXfHcjjFeeY.QX3YjM1wSO3gjNzEzW}

# Process: 
Pretty straight forward, did not have to do much else just typed '''hello''' command and got the flag. Pasted the flag into the flag section in the bar below the workspace to get the challenge completion alert. 

# What I learned: 
I learned about the commands and what commands actually mean with respect to  a Linux Terminal and how we can call specific commands to do a certain task.

# Challenge 2: Intro to arguments 
In this challenge of Linux Luminarium Dojo, Hello Hackers Module, we need to run a command along with an argument to get the flag. 

# MY SOLVE FLAG: pwn.college{0dj6Ig8U2wVu2GznrXUgNcH1UPW.QX4YjM1wSO3gjNzEzW}

# Process: 
Again a pretty straight forward command with an argument, I simply ran the '''hello hackers''' command to get the flag. This flag I copied and pasted into the Flag field in the bar below workspace area and got the challenge completion alert. 

# What I learned: 
This challenge taught me about the arguments that can be given along with a command to customize a command to suit out needs. The method usually follows the syntax of '''command argument1 argument2 .....'''.

# Challenge 3: Command History 
In this challenge of Linux Luminarium Dojo, Hello Hackers module, we need to access the list of commands which we have run, called command history to find the flag. 

# MY SOLVE FLAG: pwn.college{swt0UEXirhXArWRlFHcVhgT8keS.0lNzEzNxwSO3gjNzEzW}   

# Process:
This was also a pretty simple command in which I simply used the up arrow key to access command history and found the flag in the first execution. I then copied the flag and pasted it onto the flag section in the bar below the work area to get the challenge completion alert. 

# What I learned: 
I learned that I can often rerun the commands I have already run to save time and efforts. I can also use the command history to correct small typos such as missing a letter or not putting a dot by simple using the up arrow key and then editing the command instead of having to rewrite it as a whole.
